**GigHub** is a sample application created as part of my ongoing learning journey, using Mosh Hamedani's course lectures on plural sight (*links above*). 
Created a sample web application using **Asp.Net MVC 5 Framework**, **Repository Pattern** and **EF 6**. I went through the course materials and worked on the project in order to demonstrate
CRUD operations, Object Oriented Programming Principles. Refactoring has been done in places to improve the design of the application by following a proper refactoring process and contains unit and integration tests for robust application.

## About GigHub 
The sample application is a real-world mini social networking application where artists can post gigs online and users can add those events to their calendars, and follow artists etc.
